## Getting Started

In order to start playing the browser game, click on this [game link](https://casualfrost.github.io/Frosty-Memory-Game/).

There are 12 snowflakes to match for a total of 24 images that need to be flipped over. 

In order to get started simply click on your first guess and then proceed to click on a second guess. 

If both are matched then it will lock in place with a green border.

If both aren't a match then they will flip back over in the same spot. 

This game targets your memory skills as some of the snowflakes are similar to each other leading to a challenging experience. 

Once you match all 12 unique snowflakes then you win! Good Luck. 

Instructions are also in game.

### Next Steps

1. Animate the images swapping between each other.

2. Add lives to the game, each failed match will lower the life of the player. If player fails enough times then player loses and game resets.

3. Add more difficulties/levels. Ex: Easy = 8 matches, Normal = 12 matches, Hard = 20 matches, Impossible = 40 matches.

4. More animations and background changed, possibly make it so how many lives left affect color

## Random Facts

- When laying out the cards of a Concentration game ready for play, they are often arranged in a neat square pattern or other format to make memorising their location somewhat easier.

- A good strategy in Concentration is to first flip over the card that you are unsure of, before flipping the card that you are certain of, in case you remember incorrectly.

- There are numerous forms of the game of Concentration, and the cards are often square in shape, although some simply using traditional playing cards, while others use unique printed designs that often contain pictures, however, each set will have the same colour and design on the back of each of the cards.

- Children generally prefer to play the game of Concentration, and usually do well at the game, although adults do play to test their memorisation skills.

- On the assumption that each already revealed card is memorised in a game of Concentration, the probability of flipping over a matching card can generally be defined through the formula 1/(t-1-n), where ‘t’ is the remaining cards in play and ‘n’ is the already revealed cards that are still in play.

- The person with the most pairs at the end of a game of Concentration is deemed the winner, and while the game is typically played competitively with two or more players, it can be enjoyed by a single player aiming to flip the least amount of cards but revealing the most pairs, or to simply test their memory.

- A Japanese version of the game of Concentration, known as ‘Kai-awase’ and made from painted clam shells, is said to have been played by the wealthy, as early as the 9th century.
